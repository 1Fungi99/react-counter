# react-counter

You are required to build a Counter App using React.  The project has already been set up for you.
* There are 3 component files in the Components directory.  Use those components as the foundation for your app.
* Be sure to familiarize yourself with the project structure of the React App.  A good starting place is "App.js" and "package.json".


Required Functionality:
* Create a working Counter App.  
* Counter should be able to increment
* Counter should be able to decrement
* Counter should be able to reset back to zero
* Counter should be styled to reflect something similar to the design files given

**Bonus Functionality : 

* Counter increments by more than one (+2,+5,+10)
* Counter can show a history of values.
* Counter animation when changing values

Below are a few design ideas.
